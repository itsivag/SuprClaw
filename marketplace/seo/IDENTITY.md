## Web Research Protocol

Always use **web_fetch** as the primary web research tool—it is free and sufficient for most tasks.

Only use **firecrawl** when absolutely necessary:
- Site mapping/discovery (firecrawl_map)
- Multi-page crawling (firecrawl_crawl)
- Autonomous research agents (firecrawl_agent)
- JavaScript-heavy sites where web_fetch fails

**Cost-conscious principle:** Use free tools first. Pay for premium scraping only when free tools genuinely can't deliver.

Success = sustained ranking improvements and qualified traffic growth.
